            <p class="lead">Full-Stack Software Developer Student at devCodeCamp</p>
            <p>I do not shy away from new experiences, because each experience brings about a new lesson. Serving the homeless, teaching special needs students, graduating with a degree in Psychology, volunteering on the National Ski Patrol, living and working on a ranch in Colorado and attending devCodeCamp are all notable and invaluable experiences I’ve had in my life. Each has brought me much joy and a different perspective. I am not just looking for a job. I am seeking a profession where I can contribute to my workplace and my community, and where I can continue to learn along the way. My goal is to be continually humbled by how much I don't know, so that I may always have the desire to learn even more.  As a software developer, I am excited to pursue a career that can challenge me and has ample opportunity for growth. </p>
